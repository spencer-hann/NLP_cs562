In the second you will train a neural language model to generate new British place names. For the second part, you will find Chapter 17 of the Goldberg text to be a useful reference.\n",

On my laptop, the various networks take on the order of â‰ˆ5 minutes to train. Make sure not to wait until the last minute to do this assignment, as you will need to do a fair bit of experimentation and tinkering, and you won't want to find yourself running out of time."

    "This can be done in a variety of ways. One common (and well-performing) technique is to use trigram character frequencies, or other character-level features (writing system, etc.); some approaches rely on or incorporate word-level features. The difficulty of the task depends on a number of factors:\n",
    "\n",
    "* How much training data one has from each language of interest (often an issue)\n",

    "The last point is a major one: many texts of interest (tweets, etc.) contain a mix of languages, which can cause trouble both at the time of _training_ a language identification system as well as at the time of _inference_ (i.e., when you're actually trying to _use_ your system). The problem can be compounded by mixed writing systems: due to limitations of text-entry systems, users of some non-Latin scripts often will often write e.g. Arabic using English orthography. Names of places, brands, individuals, etc. can also cause script-level code switching. Fortunately, for this assignment, you will not need to worry about this issue.\n",

PyTorch's `nn.NLLLoss` class can accept input in this shape, and will automatically compute the average loss across the timepoints (and of course will do so a way that keeps the gradients around for correct backpropagation).
