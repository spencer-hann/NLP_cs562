In the second you will train a neural language model to generate new British place names. For the second part, you will find Chapter 17 of the Goldberg text to be a useful reference.\n",

On my laptop, the various networks take on the order of ≈5 minutes to train. Make sure not to wait until the last minute to do this assignment, as you will need to do a fair bit of experimentation and tinkering, and you won't want to find yourself running out of time."

One common (and well-performing) technique is to use trigram character frequencies, or other character-level features (writing system, etc.); some approaches rely on or incorporate word-level features. The difficulty of the task depends on a number of factors:\n",

The problem can be compounded by mixed writing systems: due to limitations of text-entry systems, users of some non-Latin scripts often will often write e.g. Arabic using English orthography. Names of places, brands, individuals, etc. can also cause script-level code switching. Fortunately, for this assignment, you will not need to worry about this issue.\n",

PyTorch's `nn.NLLLoss` class can accept input in this shape, and will automatically compute the average loss across the timepoints (and of course will do so a way that keeps the gradients around for correct backpropagation).
